This is my first project using html and css. My code creates an external website for the Nuclear Criticality Safety Program at Y-12. It is a static site. 
Improvement:
1) With future knowledge of Javascript it maybe be a good idea to revise it and create a more dynamic version. 
2) Need to also add a way to store the values users input. 
3) Need to fix the contact us page. Its kind of lame.
