                                    in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, is one of six
                                    production facilities in the National

                                    (NSE). Y-12’s unique emphasis is the
                                    processing and storage of uranium
                                    and development of technologies
                                    associated with those activities. Decades
                                    of precision machining experience
                                    make Y-12 a production facility with
                                    capabilities unequaled nationwide.

                                    to help the United States and

                                    taken 63 million lives worldwide.
                                    Afterward, Y-12 provided lithium

                                        Nuclear criticality safety is a field of nuclear engineering dedicated to 
                                        the prevention of nuclear and radiation accidents resulting from an inadvertent, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.
                                        A nuclear criticality accident occurs from operations that involve fissile material and results in a sudden and potentially lethal release of radiation.

                                        Nuclear Criticality Safety Engineers attempt to prevent nuclear criticality accidents by analyzing normal and credible abnormal conditions in fissile material 
                                        operations and designing safe arrangements for the processing of fissile materials. These "arrangements", either passive (physical), active (mechanical), or administrative (human), 
                                        are implemented by inherently safe or fault-tolerant plant designs, or, if such designs are not practical, by administrative controls such as operating procedures or job instructions 
                                        in order to minimize the potential for a nuclear criticality accident.
